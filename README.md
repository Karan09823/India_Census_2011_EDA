# India_Census_2011_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding large and complex datasets. The India Census 2011 dataset provides comprehensive demographic, social, and economic information about the population of India, covering aspects such as population size, literacy rates, gender distribution, age groups, and household conditions.
In this analysis, we explore patterns, distributions, and relationships within the dataset to gain meaningful insights about India’s population structure and development indicators in 2011.
